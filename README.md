Zaptor - a 2D Space Shooter
==============

This is the very first game I developed using Unity where the player controls a fighter to shoot enemy ships coming as waves and trying to survive as much as s/he can, inspired by the legendary shooter game [Raptor: Call of the Shadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows).
