Zaptor - a 2D Space Shooter
==============

This is the very first game I developed using Unity where the player controls a fighter to shoot enemy ships coming as waves and trying to survive as much as s/he can, inspired by the legendary shooter game [Raptor: Call of the Shadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows). 

 
Full details about the assets used in game can be found in [the assets wiki page](https://github.com/vilbeyli/2D-Shoot-Em-Up/wiki/Assets-Used-in-Game). **You can [play the game online!](http://vilbeyli.github.io/Zaptor/)** Give it a try! (Cheaters! Press backspace!)
