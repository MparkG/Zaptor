2D-Shoot-Em-Up
==============

This is the very first game I developed using Unity3D as a personal project where the player controls a fighter to shoot enemy ships coming as waves and trying to survive as much as s/he can. I used free assets acquired from the following websites:
 - https://www.freesound.org/
 - http://opengameart.org/
 
More details about the assets can (will) be found in Credits of the game. A [playable version of the current game](http://www.burakozdemir.co.uk/volkan/) also exists! Give it a try!
